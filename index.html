				<h2>Talia Cotton</h2>
				<p>is a German-born theoretical physicist. She developed the general theory of relativity, 
				one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). Cotton's work is also 
				known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Cotton is best known in popular culture 
				for her mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous 
				equation"). She received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for her "services to theoretical physics", 
				in particular her discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the evolution 
				of quantum theory.</p>
				<p>Near the beginning of her career, Cotton thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough 
				to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led 
				to the development of his special theory of relativity. She realized, however, that the principle of 
				relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of gravitation 
				in 1916, she published a paper on general relativity. She continued to deal with problems of statistical 
				mechanics and quantum theory, which led to her explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. 
				She also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of 
				light. In 1917, Cotton applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of 
				the universe.

				<h2>Core Lab Interaction</h2>
				<p>is about creating user interfaces, and understanding how they work. The focus will be on making awesome 
				things for the web. We will learn and practice the fundamentals of how to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
				in order to produce usable and engaging interfaces. We will be exploring typography, layout, visual effects, 
				responsiveness, embedding different kinds of media, and more!</p>
				<p>This course is designed to be complementary to Core Studio: Interaction (you should be enrolled in the studio 
				with the same section as this course, section D, taught by Erica Heinz). The emphasis here will be placed on 
				learning the technical things you’ll need in order to harness and apply the concepts covered in your studio class.</p>
